# collinearity
We analyze HERMES multiplicities in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering and extract non-perturbative transverse momentum dependence of unpolarized transverse momentum dependent distributions. We discuss the importance of data selection in conducting the fits of the multiplicities.  In particular   we implement   the  collinearity criteria introduced in reference~\cite{Boglione:2016bph} that allow us to study the effects of selecting data   that is  predominantly in the current fragmentation region.  We compare our parameters to previous extractions in order to better interpret our results.  We also give an outlook on what impact this criteria can have for on-going and future experiments.
